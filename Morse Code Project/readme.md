Concept and Execution

The idea of this project is to reverse-engineer one of the oldest modern telecommunication technologies, the telegraph, using modern techniques - in this case, JavaScript and MQTT. Initially intended to trigger vibrations in a smart phone, the transmission now instead takes place visually, with players needing to watch the movement of dots along the telegraph wire and translate them into text as they go. The player guesses are then graded for accuracy and speed and the results are displayed, allowing players to compare their performance without strictly making the experience competitive. 

Turning communication into a difficult, laborious process like this forces players to be contemplative about each letter as they decode it, bringing an inherent dramatic tension letter by letter which is lost in an era where whole words, paragraphs, and pages can be transmitted instantly. To ensure the process is not too difficult, however, the prompt questions which guide the telegrapher's communication are made visible to all players. 

There are two main narrative arcs that take place in the course of Morse Code Adventure - a micro arc and a macro arc. The macro arc is most readily apparent, delineated by the different "screens" of the experience: the telegrapher attempts to communicate a word, the players decipher that word, and then are evaluated in their performance before starting again. The micro loop is what makes this experience different from any other, as it takes place letter-by-letter both as the player decodes each letter as it is transmitted and as the telegrapher attempts to use an unfamiliar technology to encode their desired message. Each dot or dash adds to a player's understanding of the symbol and then in turn to the meaning of the word as a whole, allowing clever or perceptive players to deduce whole or parts of the intended message before they arrive.
